GOAL: construct AWP test meshes using both ucvm2mesh and ucvm2mesh_mpi

1) When construct configuration file for a run,
   a) number of cell for each dimension must be divisible by the grid
      partition. ie. 384 % 4 = 0 (modulo)
   b) number of nodes requested (via mpirun -node node_request) must match
      with the partition. ie. the following example is for node_request=40)

# Number of cells along each dim
nx=384
ny=248
nz=25

# Partitioning of grid among processors
px=4
py=2
pz=5
